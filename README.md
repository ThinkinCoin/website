## First Things First

Welcome. WordPress is very special to me. Every developer and contributor adds something unique to the mix, creating something beautiful. Thank you for making it part of your world.

â€” Matt Mullenweg

## Installation: Famous 5-minute install

1. Unzip the package in an empty directory and upload everything.
2. Open `wp-admin/install.php` in your browser to set up `wp-config.php` with your database connection details.
   - If this does not work, open `wp-config-sample.php`, fill in your details, save it as `wp-config.php`, and upload it.
   - Open `wp-admin/install.php` in your browser again.
3. Once the configuration file is set up, the installer will set up the tables needed for your site.
4. If you did not enter a password, note the password given to you. The default username will be `admin`.
5. The installer should then send you to the login page. Sign in with the username and password you chose during the installation.
